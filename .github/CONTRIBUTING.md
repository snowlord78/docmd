# Contributing to `docmd`

Thank you for contributing to `docmd`! We appreciate your help in making this tool faster, smarter, and more reliable.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

`docmd` is a Monorepo managed with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v20+
- **pnpm**: v10+

### 2. Setup
Clone the repository and run the automated onboarding tool to install dependencies and build the monorepo in one go:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/docmd-io/docmd.git
cd docmd

# Standard setup
pnpm onboard

# Setup + link the "docmd" command globally
pnpm onboard --link-docmd
```

### 3. Running the Dev Server
We use workspace filtering to ensure the local CLI is used during development. Start the documentation site and watch for changes in the core engine automatically:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### 4. Developer Mode
By default, the dev server watches content. To watch internal source code (templates, core engine, plugins), set the environment variable:

```bash
# Mac/Linux
DOCMD_DEV=true pnpm run dev

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:DOCMD_DEV="true"; pnpm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

Before submitting, ensure your changes haven't introduced regressions.

1. **Verification Suite:** Run our comprehensive failsafe to verify engine integrity, versioning, and plugin lifecycles:
   ```bash
   pnpm verify
   ```
2. **Conventional Commits:** We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Use prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, or `docs:`.
3. **Copyright Header:** All new files in `packages/` must include the standard project copyright header. Please copy the header from any existing file in the `src/` directory.
